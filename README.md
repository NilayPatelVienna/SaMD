Evolving Regulatory Framework for Software as a Medical Device based on Machine Learning
**1 SaMD Overview**

Software is one of the most important components of the healthcare industry. Before we dig into more details, we must distinguish mainly between the two types of software: 
1. Software used for medical purposes, such as
- Clinical decision making (e.g. detection of anomalies in Lung CT scans)
2. Software used for non-medical purposes, such as
- Calculator/data processing modules that maintain and retrieve laboratory data
- Continuous glucose monitor secondary displays
- Medical device data systems, 
- Home uterine monitors
- Medical image storage devices, 
- Medical image communication devices 
- Any administrative service (e.g. hospital billing services) 
- Software used to make or maintain a device (e.g. testing, source code management, servicing, etc.)
